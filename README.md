# Revisionist History
A silly repo, but fun. A lesson prompt to create a Tic Tac Toe game taken a bit too far. At the time of git init,
python has always been on my radar. I've occasionally written a few lines, but mostly just `po object` in the xcode
IDE. I've decided to learn a bit more. Between a few books, a few online courses, and a supportive friend, I've decided
to revise this script when I have time. I think it will be interesting to see the progress and a good opportunity to apply
new concepts.

## Road Map
* v1 - Get the job done as quickly and dirty as possible **done**
* v2 - Make the solution a bit less dirty
* v3 - Be a little too cute and roll back
* v4 - Create Docs
* v5 - Create Test 
* v6 - Add GUI
* v7 - (optional) Add Networking
* v8 - (optional) Add Computer Opponent
* v9 - (optional) Add Game Variations
* v10 - Realize this is a Tic Tac Toe game and move on! (could also be v2, depending on time)
